# Changelog

## 0.4.0

### Changed

- Renamed to **pterodocs**. The plural reads as what it is — a documentation
  publisher — where the singular read as one document. The packages are
  `pterodocs`, `@pterodocs/core`, `@pterodocs/docusaurus` and
  `@pterodocs/wordpress`; the command is `pterodocs`; the WordPress plugin's
  slug, text domain and option key follow.

  Two things deliberately did not follow.

  The default media slug prefix stays `pterodoc`. That string is the identity of
  every file already in a site's media library — a slug is `<prefix>-<content
  hash>` — so renaming it would orphan every upload and send them all again. It
  is a key rather than branding, and nobody sees it. Set `media.slugPrefix` if
  you want it to match.

  And the old names still answer. `pterodoc.config.*` is still discovered, and
  every `PTERODOC_*` environment variable still works, each with a notice
  saying what it is called now. An existing project needs no edits beyond the
  dependency itself.

- Earlier versions are published as `pterodoc` and stop at 0.3.0.

## 0.3.0

### Added

- Documentation now looks like documentation with nothing installed. WordPress
  renders core blocks with almost no opinion, so a published page arrived as an
  unstyled outline: list markers down the navigation, a column too narrow to
  hold a word, code in the body font. Three changes fix that, and none of them
  needs a plugin.

  - A stylesheet is published with the pages (`render.styles`, `inline` by
    default). Every colour in it is mixed from `currentColor`, so it follows a
    theme into dark rather than assuming light, and every rule sits inside
    `:where()`, so a theme that has its own opinions keeps them.
  - Fences are tokenised at publish time with Prism running in Node
    (`render.highlight`, on by default). What is stored is Prism's classes,
    never colours, so the markup stays a plain core code block and the palette
    stays in CSS. It is the same vocabulary the WordPress plugin's browser-side
    Prism produces, so one set of rules dresses both.
  - The documentation layout is full width by default (`layout.align`), which
    is what it was always meant to be.

- The stylesheet is also written to `docs.css` beside the rendered pages,
  whether or not the pages carry it. Storing it on every page is what makes a
  site work with nothing installed, but it is the same few kilobytes over and
  over: pasting that file into Appearance, Customise, Additional CSS once and
  setting `render.styles` to `none` costs a minute and nothing thereafter. The
  command line says so after a render.

### Fixed

- The two columns overflowed the page. They carry inline `flex-basis` of 25% and
  75%, which together are the whole content box, so any gap pushed the document
  off the right edge — and an inline style cannot be overridden from a
  stylesheet. The root is a grid now, where `flex-basis` is inert and `1fr`
  accounts for the gap by itself. `layout.navWidth` still applies; it arrives as
  a custom property, since the inline one is ignored.
- That rule then never applied, because it was wrapped in `:where()`, which
  scores zero specificity — core's own `.wp-block-columns{display:flex}` won at
  every width. `:where()` is right wherever a theme should be able to override
  pterodoc, and wrong for the layout, which has to win.
- The navigation sheet was anchored to the top of small screens: the desktop
  sidebar sets `top`, the sheet set `bottom`, and a box with both anchors to
  `top`.

### Changed

- `layout.align` defaults to `full` rather than to no alignment, and pages now
  carry a stylesheet, so the first sync after upgrading rewrites every page.
  Set `render.styles` to `none` and `layout.align` to `''` to keep the previous
  output exactly.

## 0.2.0

### Changed

- Split into an npm workspace of four packages: `@pterodoc/core` (rendering, the site
  model, the target contract, configuration and the reconciler), `@pterodoc/docusaurus`
  (the site loader and its readers), `@pterodoc/wordpress` (the REST target) and
  `pterodoc` (the command line, the Docusaurus build plugin and the public barrel).
  The dependency graph points inwards and npm enforces it. The public surface of
  `pterodoc` is unchanged, `pterodoc/plugin` still resolves, and the goldens still match
  byte for byte.
- The site model, the page tree, the `SourceReader` contract and model capture moved out
  of the Docusaurus layer: they describe what a source produces, not how Docusaurus
  produces it. `pterodoc --model` and every fixture-driven test now resolve without
  Docusaurus in the graph at all.
- The command line and the Docusaurus plugin build the target through one
  `resolveTarget`, rather than each spelling out the same options. The plugin also
  accepts a `target` of its own.
- The version is stamped into the build instead of found by walking up the tree looking
  for a manifest, which under a workspace would have found the wrong one and silently
  reported `0.0.0`.
- Installing from a git URL is no longer supported; install `pterodoc` from npm.

### Added

- A WordPress plugin, in `packages/wordpress/plugin`, that turns the pages
  pterodoc publishes into a documentation experience: a full-width layout with
  prose kept to a comfortable measure while code and tables run to the column
  edge, syntax highlighting and a copy button, a sidebar that collapses to the
  section being read and scrolls on its own, a bottom sheet or drawer on small
  screens, and tables that scroll inside their own keyboard-reachable region.

  It registers no block types. Everything is layered over the core blocks
  pterodoc already writes, through `render_block` filters, one stylesheet and one
  script — so deactivating it leaves documentation that is still readable and
  still navigable. Site-wide defaults live on a settings page; any single block
  can override them from the block inspector.

  Its design is built on the block supports rather than around them. Every token
  resolves through a theme's own global-styles variables first, syntax colours
  are derived with `color-mix` from the code block's resolved colours so a
  palette choice repaints them to match, the gutter is padding on the column
  rather than on any block so `spacing` composes, and every default sits inside
  `:where()` so anything set in the inspector wins. There is no `!important` in
  the stylesheet.

- `render.blocks`, either `'core'` (the default, and byte-for-byte what pterodoc
  emitted before) or `'plugin'`. The second carries instructions the plugin can
  act on in block-comment attributes only, never in markup, so WordPress stores
  the same content either way and the editor has nothing to object to.

- Highlighted line ranges survive when `render.blocks` is `'plugin'`. A
  `{1,3-5}` on a fence had no core equivalent and was reported as dropped; it is
  now carried and rendered.

- `pterodoc doctor` reports whether the plugin is installed, and warns when its
  class prefix disagrees with `render.classPrefix` — a mismatch that otherwise
  publishes cleanly, loads cleanly and silently styles nothing.

### Fixed

- `pterodoc/plugin` shipped an `exports` entry pointing at a declaration file that is not
  where tsc emits one, so the subpath resolved to `any` for every consumer.
- `@types/mdast`, `@types/hast` and `@types/github-slugger` were development
  dependencies, but the emitted declarations refer to those types; they are now real
  dependencies of `@pterodoc/core`.
- The fake WordPress used by the tests set `title` twice in one object literal, so the
  first was always dead. Typechecking the test suites, which nothing did before, found
  it.
- Six tests asserted POSIX absolute paths and could not pass on Windows, where
  `path.resolve` prepends the drive letter. They now build their fixtures with `path`.

### Removed

- `remark-emoji`, which was declared as a dependency and never imported.

## 0.1.0

### Added
- Project skeleton: TypeScript sources, a Rollup build emitting `lib/`, declarations from
  `tsc`, and a `prepare` script so the package can be consumed straight from git.
- Errors and exit codes, structured issues, path, hash and media-type helpers.
- The renderer: markdown to Gutenberg blocks, with a configurable class prefix and string
  table so the output is not tied to one site's theme. Verified byte-identical to the
  DocStack script it was extracted from on a shared fixture.

- The site model, read from Docusaurus itself through its own site loader: resolved
  sidebars with autogenerated entries already expanded, versions, locales, permalinks,
  draft and unlisted flags, and previous/next links. pterodoc never walks a docs
  directory or parses a sidebar file.
- The page tree, ordered by the sidebar, with directory pages named by their category.
- Model capture, so a site can be rendered without Docusaurus and a bug can be reported
  reproducibly.

- The WordPress target: page creation and updates identified by parent and slug, so a
  re-run rewrites only what differs; media upload keyed by content hash; pruning that
  trashes rather than deletes.
- The reconciler, the configuration file and the command line (`sync`, `render`,
  `doctor`, `capture`, `init`), with rendered pages, a manifest and a plan written for
  every run.

- MDX: imports and comments are removed, `Tabs` and `TabItem` become collapsible
  sections that need no script, `Details`, `CodeBlock` and `Admonition` become their
  block equivalents, and plain HTML is carried through. A component or an expression
  with no equivalent is reported with its file, line and column rather than dropped.

- Images: references are found wherever they sit, resolved against the document, the
  localised copy, the static directories or `@site/`, uploaded to the media library and
  rewritten. A file is identified by the hash of its contents, carried in its media slug,
  so a fresh checkout never uploads anything twice.
- Versions and locales, each published into its own subtree with its own navigation.
- A Docusaurus plugin, for a site that would rather publish from `postBuild`.

### Fixed
Carried over from the original script, each with a test:
- Reference-style links (`[text][ref]`) resolve instead of printing as literal text, and
  the definitions no longer appear on the page.
- Images are found wherever they sit, so a standalone image becomes an image block and an
  inline one stays inline. Their URLs and alt text are escaped.
- Shortcode brackets are escaped on the tree rather than by pattern-matching the HTML, so
  a `>` inside an attribute no longer confuses the escaper.
- A leading H1 is recognised as the title even when a comment precedes it.
- Code fences keep their `title` and `showLineNumbers`; a dropped highlight range is
  reported rather than lost in silence.
